# bbdq

A spiritual fork of [blue-bots-done-quick](https://github.com/olafmoriarty/blue-bots-done-quick) with two major interventions:

1. Pure TS (specifically [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/) for the "CMS")
2. Separation of the "CMS" server (where one creates and edits bots) from the server where the bots are run.

See the [agenda](./agenda.md) for more details.
